# speech-to-text
Examining the transcript of Honoring the Life and Legacy of Lt. Collins, whisper did a remarkable job. It got every single word correct in a near-two minute video, even when there was ample background noise near the end. 

This was a relatively easy task for whisper â€” most of the speakers spoke into a mic and used common English words. The only suggestion I would have is to differentiate speakers in some way (not sure if whisper currently has the capability to do so). In a video like this, where so many people are speaking, identifying them as different individuals would be very helpful for transcription purposes.
